## Reasoning

Part of the exercise in improving/building the reaction-diffusion simulator was so that I build the code needed to explore the next tattoo I plan on getting. I thought of this tattoo after a challenging vipassana course (although it was many years in the making). The tattoo represents my evolving relationship with engineering and science. The tattoo will be a Turing-pattern, generated via the [FitzHugh-Nagumo equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FitzHugh%E2%80%93Nagumo_model), which is by-design, different in length scale to the patterns I generated in my [final paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2590238525002516) during my PhD. The tattoo will use pointilism as a way of deconstructing the patterns into finite building blocks, like protocells in nature or transistors in computation. 

A key macroscopic feature will be that the design will have a sharp break in the middle that represents embryogenesis, the phenomena I find most fascinating in biology, while also representing a break in my views/hopes of science. It's an important transition for me away from viewing science as almost a spiritual endeavor to a more practical view of finding challenging problems without compromising on my lifestyle and goals.
