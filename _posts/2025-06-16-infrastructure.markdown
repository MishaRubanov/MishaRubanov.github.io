I was recently on reddit, trying to figure out why monorepos just *feel* right, and I stumbled upon [this article](https://danluu.com/monorepo/) discussing the advantages to monorepos.

It's a wild ride that I've come on - from being a strict molecular programmer, to a hardware engineer, to a begruding software engineer, to slowly but surely seeing an infrastructure engineer peek out at me... it's a wild ride.

Now that I'm in the middle of it all I realize that in the end, I like making tools that make life easier and this is just the natural progression that this takes. And now that I'm in it, I really get to see and understand this for what it is.
