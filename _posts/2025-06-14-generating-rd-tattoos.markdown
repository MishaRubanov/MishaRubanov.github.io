With the infrastructure in place, it's time to actually generate a tattoo to commemorate the last ~7 years of my life.

This is the symbolism I want layered into this tattoo:

* The Turing pattern will be a uniquely-generated tattoo to represent my detatchment from doing truely basic science, for systemic academic reasons. The pattern will be a dot pattern (similar to [these tattoos](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/dotwork-tattoos/)) (specifically the pointilism-style tattoos) where the dots each represent a single cell/transistor - the basis for computing that I build my PhD around, and the basis which I keep on chugging along.

* The design will be encompassed in oval-like cellular structures, with a sharp break in the middle to represent some of the disillusionment I felt with science/engineering in general.
